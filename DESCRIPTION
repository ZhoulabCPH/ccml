Description: Consensus clustering, also called meta-clustering or cluster ensembles, has been increasingly 
    used in clinical data. Current consensus clustering methods tend to ensemble a number of different 
    clusters from mathematical replicates with similar sample coverage. As the fact of common variety
    of sample coverage in the real-world data, a new consensus clustering strategy dealing with
    such biological replicates is required. This is a two-step consensus clustering package, which
    is used to input multiple predictive labels with different sample coverage (missing labels).
